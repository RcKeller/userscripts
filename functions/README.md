## Functions
Single functions that can be required by TamperMonkey. These are my personal variants of common utilities used by the Monkey community, updated to ES7 while maintaining backwards compatibility.

- [waitForKeyElements](waitForKeyElements.js) - Executes callbacks after DOM elements are loaded asynchronously
